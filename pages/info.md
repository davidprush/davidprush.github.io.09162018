So I'll give this [Jekyll][1] thing a try and see what I can with it...

{% include alert info="Welcome, I hope to use this space to express my thoughts, concerns, and opinions about everything and anything related to technology. If you don't care for what I might have to say...great, move on. I don't want to waste anyone's time." %}

I don't have a target audience for this blog but I plan on writing about projects I'm working on and stuff I find interesting. I usually tweet about information technology, open source software, Linux, and digital rights and you can follow me [@davidprush][6]. I work for the United States Air Force as an avionics technician; I plan on continuing my military career until 2026. After I retire from military I plan pursuing a career in software engineering. My interest in computer programming started in [early grade school][7] and progressed from AP Computer Science to attending the University of Pittsbugrh for Information Science. For some reason a computer science degree was not something I seriously considered--maybe it was the advanced math. Nonetheless, my love for computers--especially Linux--continued to evolve and still provides a meaningful experience for me today.


## Current Interests:


* [Jekyll & Web development][1]
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux][2]
* [Optimizing Performance][3]
* [Listening to Podcasts][4]
* [Reading this right now][5]

## My main curiosities are open source software and programming...




{% include alert text="I firmly believe that without open source software the internet and technology would not be as advanced as it is today." %}




## Technical skills developed over the years:


* Master Distro-Hopper
* Amateur programmer: VBA, Python, C++, Bash scripting, and now working on Ruby
* Familiar with web servers and networking
* Honorable mention...Microsoft Office & application integration




### Contact Info

#### For, now I will be learning Ruby, Jeckyll, anything Linux.


Let's have fun...[davidprush.com][13]
