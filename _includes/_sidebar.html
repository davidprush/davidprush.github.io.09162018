            I don't have a target audience for this blog but I plan on writing about projects I'm working on and stuff I find interesting. I usually tweet about information technology, open source software, Linux, and digital rights and you can follow me
            <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.socialmedia.twitter }}">@davidprush</a>. I work for the United States Air Force as an avionics technician; I plan on continuing my military career until 2026. After I retire from military I plan pursuing
            a career in software engineering. My interest in computer programming started in <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/fanatic-no-more">early grade school</a> and progressed from AP Computer Science to attending the University of Pittsbugrh
            for Information Science. For some reason a computer science degree was not something I seriously considered--maybe it was the advanced math. Nonetheless, my love for computers--especially Linux--continued to evolve and still provides a meaningful
            experience for me today.
